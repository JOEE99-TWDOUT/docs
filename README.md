[![Build GitHub Docs on Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/?repo=github)

Welcome to the GitHub Docs repository! Here you'll find the code and Markdown source files for [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com). GitHub's Documentation team develops content in a private repository, which is synced regularly with this public repo.

Use the table of contents icon <img alt="Table of contents icon" src="./contributing/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> in the top-right corner for easy navigation.

## Contributing

We welcome a variety of contributions, many of which don't require any coding. For detailed instructions on how to get started, visit "[About contributing to GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/about-contributing-to-github-docs)."

### How to Contribute

On the GitHub Docs site, you can contribute by clicking the **Make a contribution** button at the bottom of any page. This opens a pull request for simple fixes like typos, broken links, or small updates.

For more involved contributions, you can set up a local environment or create a Codespace. Learn more in "[Setting up your environment to work on GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/setting-up-your-environment-to-work-on-github-docs)."
